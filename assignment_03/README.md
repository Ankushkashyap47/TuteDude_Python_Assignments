# Assignment 02 
**Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd **

Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.

Solution:
Step 1: The input() function is used to take an integer input from the user.
Step 2: Logic implemented:
    a. A number is taken as input from the user.
    b. The program checks whether the number is divisible by 2 or not.
    c. If num % 2 == 0 is True, the number is even.
    d. If num % 2 == 1 is True, the number is odd.
Step 3: An if block is used to check whether the number is even (when num % 2 == 0 ) and prints "number is even" 
        if the condition is True.
Step 4: An else block is used to handle the odd number case and prints "number is odd" if the condition is False.

**Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop **

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.

Solution:
Step 1: A variable named sum is declared and initialized with the value 0.
Step 2: A for loop is used to iterate from 1 to 50. During each iteration, the current value of the loop variable i 
    is added to sum. This process continues until the loop completes all 50 iterations, resulting in the total sum of
    numbers from 1 to 50.
Step 3: The calculated total sum is printed using the sum variable and print() function.
